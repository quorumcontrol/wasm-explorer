# Tupelo ChainTree Explorer (and Wallet)

This is an example react-based app using the new [Tupelo Wasm SDK](https://github.com/QuorumControl/tupelo-wasm-sdk). It is both an explorer and a wallet. That repo has a lot more context and detail about what this application is trying to teach.

There are a series of videos walking through this app here: https://youtu.be/4Oz03l9IQPc, here: https://youtu.be/4CJYIIKdoFw and here: https://youtu.be/kjysUm0eTKc .

The first video, in particular, will give you a high-level overview of Tupelo itself.
